  At first impression, I have to admit, HTML/CSS seemed pretty trivial to me as a web developer.  I thought a little bit more familiarization on
  HTML/CSS would have made me an expert in days.  However, when I was introduced to Semantic UI, my whole thought process changed dramatically.  I felt 
  like I was in almost an entirely different ballpark as far as HTML/CSS goes and web development.  HTML/CSS had a cookie cutter way on how to approach a website.  
  Semantic UI did not.  Semantic UI involved some intricate and partially trivial parts on how to make a website.  I almost as to dare say that Semantic UI was like writing pseudocode in actual syntax.
