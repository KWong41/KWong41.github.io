I found Javascript to be almost exactly the same as my previous studied language of Java.  I am a complete newbie when it comes to programming languages of Javascript, however the Javascript website, freecodecamp has helped me in learning how to code.  I feel like I am not much of a coder.  This website and also the practice WODs have been helpful in trying to understand javascript.  I didn’t completely understand how Java works but I feel like in this class, I will be able to understand javascript a little bit better with repetition and understanding.  
	Javascript is a good language for programmers but a bad language for newbies.  Also, I feel like Javascript can often be confusing because Javascript isn’t necessarily the easiest reading coding language in the world(I feel like Python is a pretty good language to learn without learning anything).  Javascript is a dynamic language though similar to Java.  I like the fact that Javascript can code website development.  This however is not an easy task by any means.  Professional web developers probably get stumped at places of employment like Amazon or Reddit.  That is why I feel like I need to focus well in this class so that I can get an A and learn how to fix problems (hopefully similar) that are Object-Oriented.  
	The Workouts of the Day are highly stressful because it is timed.  I often get anxiety because the first two WODs that we did, I was clueless when trying to answer simple problems such as the “fibonacci sequence”.  It takes me about an hr to try and wrap my head around the problem itself and then I start coding the start and end.  I’m not sure if this is the correct way to learn code but I try to find patterns to answer the problem.
