Javascript is a great all-around language that teaches you the basics of syntax well.  I think Javascript is a less sophisticated software language than it's predecessors.  The languages C#, C++, Java, CSS, PHP, HTML, and SQL I feel are slightly more complicated because in Javascript, you can declare primitive data types with one word instead of specific strings.  The bracketing I feel is a less strict than other languages also.  If statements, for loops, functions, and the like don't require as much syntax for the same application to run in Javascript.  In that sense, Javascript seems a little more straightforward and simpler to understand than other languages because of this.  I am a complete newbie in Javascript and I feel that most of the language is identically similar to Java.  Overall from an engineering perspective, I think Javascript is a good programming language to a certain extent.  There are some flaws to Javascript and I think Professor Johnson has pointed this out for a little bit.  The variable declaration I feel can be a problem.  There are global variables and local variables that can be declared inside or outside of the function (which is nothing new) but when you don't have the functionality to call a function as private or public, I feel that may become an issue between global and local variables.
	
Athletic software engineering can be a good idea however, I feel in this day and age, this is not an ideal way to train students for real world functionality and productivitiy.  Nobody including coding interviews will tell you to sit down and time yourself to take on a task like this.  Having said that, it is a good way to learn about what things do in code.  You can gauge to see where you stand as far as javascript familiarization goes.  Plus it is a good way to see what you you did wrong (which is most important) and what you did right.  Practice WODs are somewhat useful but it is very stressful especially for beginners.  When you get stuck (which is often for me), you have a hard time trying to piece everything together from translating the logic of the code to syntax.  
	
Finally, Javascript is a good language to learn even though it might not be the most user friendly.  Most coding languages like Javascript aren't meant to be a perfect language.  I can imagine that experienced users of Javascript would get frustrated in writing code for this language as well because of the aforementioned issues.  I have had multiple issues where my code on previous class assignments would look correct but it would be wrong in syntax.  I think I would probably experience similar issues with this language.  This is where another issue of frustration would begin to arise.  The functionality of Javascript would not translate well if you know previous languages.  The transition from previous languages to Javascript would be confusing because unlike Java or C, Javascript is a slightly simpler language to write code in than it's predecessors.
