  At first impression, I have to admit, HTML/CSS seemed pretty trivial to me as a web developer.  I thought a little bit more familiarization on
  HTML/CSS would have made me an expert in days.  However, when I was introduced to Semantic UI, my whole thought process changed dramatically.  I felt 
  like I was in almost an entirely different ballpark as far as HTML/CSS goes and web development.  HTML/CSS had a cookie cutter way on how to approach a website.  
  Semantic UI did not.  Semantic UI involved some intricate and partially trivial parts on how to make a website.  I almost as to dare say that Semantic UI was like writing pseudocode in actual syntax.  
  Yet, why did I have the most frustration in trying to get this unique coding language to work!?  I think it is because that while yes, HTML/CSS offered some of the basics as far as web development is concerned, Semantic UI offers some semi-difficult parts of writing a developmental website from scratch.  I don't think a beginner could get used to Semantic UI because 
  simply that the language is not at all user-friendly.  In fact, I have had the most frustrating time trying to get anything to work in this particular framework.  With that said, Semantic UI has opened up my eyes to new depths because it taught me a whole lot of positives.  Positives like, perseverance, hard work, and learning how to correct your mistakes trivially unlike other coding languages.
