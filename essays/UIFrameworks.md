  At first impression, I have to admit, HTML/CSS seemed pretty trivial to me as a web developer.  I thought a little bit more familiarization on HTML/CSS would have made me an expert in days.  However, when I was introduced to Semantic UI, my whole thought process changed dramatically.  I felt like I was in almost an entirely different ballpark as far as HTML/CSS goes and web development.  HTML/CSS had a cookie cutter way on how to approach a website.  
  Semantic UI did not.  Semantic UI involved some intricate and partially trivial parts on how to make a website.  I almost as to dare say that Semantic UI was like writing pseudocode in actual syntax.  
  Yet, why did I have the most frustration in trying to get this unique coding language to work!?  I think it is because that while yes, HTML/CSS offered some of the basics as far as web development is concerned, Semantic UI offers some semi-difficult parts of writing a developmental website from scratch.  I don't think a beginner could get used to Semantic UI because simply that the language is not at all user-friendly.  In fact, I have had the most frustrating time trying to get anything to work in this particular framework.  With that said, Semantic UI has opened up my eyes to new depths because it taught me a whole lot of positives.  
  Positives like, perseverance, hard work, and learning how to correct your mistakes trivially unlike other coding languages.  I also thought that if you were to familiarize yourself with Semantic UI, you could do a whole lot of unbelievable web development on the front-end side.  Anyone that is good at Semantic UI, could positively help a company very well.  Someone with a creative mind could make a website look like something straight out of a Hollywood movie.  
  Having studied this framework for about a week now, Semantic UI isn't my cup of tea.  I have to be honest.  HTML/CSS seems good and great but Semantic UI was so frustrating to me that I couldn't picture myself doing this day in and day out.  Most of the reason was because I could spend literally hours trying to keep track of the "Devs" and the "classes" in this framework.  I could imagine how hard it would be in the real world if someone was really using this UI as part of a front-end web development job.  Imagine trying to look at HTML/CSS Semantic UI framework code that has thousands if not hundreds of thousands of code in their disposal and just because there was one single missing <dev> that it would mess up the ENTIRE website. 
  To close, Semantic UI isn't a bad coding language.  As a matter of fact, I appreciate how intricate Semantic UI really is.  It is a coding language, in the right hands, could be a finely sharpened tool in the tools of coding languages.  Semantic UI has a dedicated website for their operating words too.  I don't believe every language in tech has a dedicated website like Semantic UI does.  However with that being said, Semantic UI isn't for me.
