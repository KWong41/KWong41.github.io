    Eric Raymond and Rick Moen, longtime advocates of the tech industry, describes to their readers that asking questions the "smart way" is an ideal way of being increasingly efficient on learning how to budget your time through your career whether as an intern or as a long time sofware developer.  Smart questions are important for software engineers.  This gives you a generalized way of increasing your problem solving skills.  I feel like this is a way to increase "on-the-job" training throughout your career as a software engineer however, it is NOT the only way. 
    
    The essay that Eric Raymond has described seemed inaccurate because they call other people that does not use this method as "idiots" that "asks stupid questions based on wrong assumptions".  I am a huge supporter of asking questions.  It does not matter if it was stupid or smart questions, just on the basis of asking a question means that someone is trying to clarify some bits of confusion based on whatever task they were asked to do.  Learning how to do something not only takes skill and talent but also an extra serving of clarity.  
    
    I researched two different topics (the smart way and the not so smart way) on stackoverflow and I have discovered that in both situations, these chosen questions fulfill the precepts for smart questions because they exemplify a way to finding the answer through trial and error.  The not so smart question asks a straight-forward question without looking into the topic further but it does have dramatically more upvotes (on stackoverflow) which gives me reason to say that this question clarified many problems other people had in the past.  
    
    The insight I have gained as a result of this experience has given me a different perspective on future career opportunitites in a workplace environment.  Learning how to utilize your resources before asking a question through the internet is common sense to me.  If you are trying to solve a problem, it is likely that someone else already solved this problem.  Even if this same problem hasn't been solved yet, it is likely your co-workers or fellow students that came across a similar problem.  Fundamentally, troubleshooting how to solve the problem before asking different questions to the problem is key to asking the right (smart) questions.  Lastly, I feel like there is no "stupid" or "smart" question if you follow the process that Eric Raymond has eluded to in his essay.
