Ivy League schools such as Harvard and Yale had their own independent social networking website which eventually turned into facebook by Mark Zuckerburg.  Why can't we implement some type of social network here at UH?  By doing this, we can increase productivity, teamwork, and comraderie amongst fellow undergraduate and graduate students alike.  We could also extend this social network to professors, faculty, and alumni of the university.  Since everyone in the University of Hawaii has a hawaii.edu e-mail, we could use this as a platform for them to create user accounts.

A mockup page idea would possibly look similar to facebook but have our own University of Hawaii at Manoa twist to it.  The website will have a homepage link, a message board, icons for possible links to other social media, the date of when the user posted this message int he message board, profile picture, and finally a customizable background.  For example, instead of the blue css that facebook uses, we could use a green/white/black css frontpage to go along with this website.  We would also have to make some type of template for the frontpage and other pages to go with this website when a user visits and clicks on links.  

Some of the case ideas would be to add a friend, editing their homepage, importing their profile pictures, some type of way to make a group, and finally a way to sign in and out of this website.  These ideas would be utilized well by being familiar with the various coding languages and front end user interface templates.  This would mean that debugging this project would become a problem in the development of this website.  We would also have to log in the steps taken to develop this website so that possible developers could also provide continuity of this project.  The database to store all of the users and information would also be utilized.  This could create a problem because database systems is not something that we have learned in this class. 

Beyond the basics could be utilized by extending this social network platform to other campuses in UH Manoa system.  We could also use this website as an admin board for their UH professional portfolio.  The "special sauce" could be implementing some type of search algorithm so that other people could find their friends on this social networking site.  For example, files that could be seen for the administrator should not be able to be seen as a user.  We could also use some type of GPS navigation system to identify where this user posted information about where they work or where they posted a message on their homepage.
