Many people think of “coding standards” in a trivial way—i.e. minutae such as how many spaces to indent, or whether you place the close-curly-brace on a new line by itself.

I, on the other hand, think that if you can only implement one software engineering technique to improve quality, it should be coding standards. Indeed, I believe some coding standards can actually help you learn a programming language. Do you agree?

After your first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, what are your impressions? Are you finding that getting the green checkmark is painful, or useful, or both, or something else entirely?

Write an interesting, informative essay on coding standards that addresses some or all of the above questions, or goes in a different direction entirely regarding coding standards. Make sure it provides your personal perspective and useful insights.

  After playing around with installing IntelliJ and following through with the necessary settings and installations through the commandline and such,
  I believe that this ESLint tool increases clarification in trying to send a message to your fellow co-workers, classmates, friends, whoever that might read your code.
  
  As software engineers, there are multiple different ways of coding a program through various different languages, algorithms, problem solving techniques and so on.  ESLint provides that extra clarification in trying to understand what is going on while coding.  ESLint is a quick way to fix typing errors or spacing errors on the fly that many people in the industry would probably wouldn't notice until they actually do it themselves.  For example, let's say you are working for the New York Times.  Your editor(boss) tells you that you need to write an article about a particular subject.  You write several pages of this subject but you have noticed that you have grammatical errors in this article.  You fix them and then you turn them into your editor.  Your editor then comes back and tells you that you have spelling errors or spacing errors.  You fix those and you turn it back into your editor.  Well, ESLint is the editor and the employee (you) is the coder.  You code two or three pages of what your boss wants you to write and then you get ESLint to check for "spelling" errors or "grammatical" errors.  No problem right?  Since ESLint gives you a pretty clear way of fixing these "errors". 

  Getting that checkmark in ESLint format doesn't seem to be very hard since ESLint tells the coder what is going wrong in a typically clear and concise fashion.  For me, if I come across an error in my code (aside from using ESLint), I often would have to google the error but ESLint makes it easy to find errors along the way.  Other errors (not supported by ESLint) that would make the program not run correctly would of course cause some type of error message that would be too complicated for the average developer to understand off the top of their head.  
  
  As for the negatives, I did have trouble trying to install ESLint.  I had to try and mess around with the troubleshooting that ESLint provided (It took me at least six or seven tries until I actually got ESLint to work).  I feel like the hardest part of implementing a coding standard like ESLint is by actually getting ESLint to work through the command line and through intelliJ.
