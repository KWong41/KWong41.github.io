  ESLint is a coding-based tool that provides a good understanding on how a software engineeer can code in a clear and concise manner.  The basic standards that ESLint provides shows the user a strict way of learning how to code immaculately by correcting the coder in utilizing spaces, tabs, extra lines, and utilizing other functions that are not used in Javascript.  
  
  As software engineers, there are multiple different ways of coding a program through various different languages, algorithms, problem solving techniques and so on.  ESLint provides that extra clarification in trying to understand what is going on while coding.  ESLint is a quick way to fix typing errors or spacing errors on the fly that many people in the industry would probably wouldn't notice until they actually do it themselves.  For example, let's say you are working for the New York Times.  Your editor(boss) tells you that you need to write an article about a particular subject.  You write several pages of this subject but you have noticed that you have grammatical errors in this article.  You fix them and then you turn them into your editor.  Your editor then comes back and tells you that you have spelling errors or spacing errors.  You fix those and you turn it back into your editor.  Well, ESLint is the editor and the employee (you) is the coder.  You code two or three pages of what your boss wants you to write and then you get ESLint to check for "spelling" errors or "grammatical" errors.  No problem right?  Since ESLint gives you a pretty clear way of fixing these "errors". 

  Getting that checkmark in ESLint format doesn't seem to be very hard since ESLint tells the coder what is going wrong in a typically clear and concise fashion.  For me, if I come across an error in my code (aside from using ESLint), I often would have to google the error but ESLint makes it easy to find errors along the way.  Other errors (not supported by ESLint) that would make the program not run correctly would of course cause some type of error message that would be too complicated for the average developer to understand off the top of their head.  
  
  In a oral presentational type of format(for example company meetings), I know that ESLint would provide a good way to explain what developers are doing in code to their team as well as their supervisors.  Using tabs, spaces, and other comma-redacted forms of code would make way for teams to get up to speed as to what you want to do in your code.  
  
  As for the negatives, I did have trouble trying to install ESLint.  I had to try and mess around with the troubleshooting that ESLint provided (It took me at least six or seven tries until I actually got ESLint to work).  I feel like the hardest part of implementing a coding standard like ESLint is by actually getting ESLint to work through the command line and through intelliJ.
