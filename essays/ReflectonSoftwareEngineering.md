  A reflection on software engineering means a whole lot of information.  There are so many things to learn that I feel like it is impossible to learn everything there is in software engineering. 
Having said that, the topics that I went through in this course was enlightening because I wasn't sure what to do after college before taking a web-development class.  I feel inspired to become a web-application developer (possibly a full-stack developer).  These past six months of my life has been driven almost entirely about web-development.  I have a web-developmental school job, I have attended the Hawai'i Annual Code Challenge (basically web dev application solving), and I have took this ICS 314 class to give me a purpose in college.  Now that I have done these things, I want to do something with it.  I often browse the internet and look at the intricacies of a website.  I often ask myself if I can do that myself (especially the google search engine algorithm.  That is a genius work of art).  My passion on doing something in computer science did not die, as a matter of fact, it rekindled the drive that I had to become a better professional in computer science.
  Let's go over the top two topics that I think I can grow beyond web development.
  The first topic that I would like to share is "Functional Programming".  Working smarter not harder is involved in just about everything that we do in life.  Nobody would want to walk to work if you have a car right?  Same idea here.  I feel like I have a good understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.  By using the theoretical programming concepts in DS&A, whoever I work with we can work together by implementing an algorithm or problem-solving concept to achieve the highest of efficiency.
  The second topic that I would like to share is "Agile Project Management".  In the near-future, I believe working with other people well is inevitable in computer science.  We will all have to be mentored or teach someone else how to do something.  Sometimes, someone will need to take the wheel and drive their projects to success.  I think I can be a good project manager in the future because I am talented at Agile Project Management (Team coordination, planning, issue management).
