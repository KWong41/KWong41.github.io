<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/vacay-home-page.png">

  Maintained a successful deployment in Afghanistan by keeping sustainment of a camp by utilizing culinary arts to learn how to properly manage a team of local nationals to complete meals for US and allied troops three times a day.  This became my job for about six months.  As time progressed, this became progressively harder because my area was close to enemy forces.  The fact that we were close to enemy forces meant that we were on high danger territory.
