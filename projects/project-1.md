In the Colorado Springs area, there is a base called Peterson Air Force Base.  Within this base, there is a dining facility open to the enlisted members of the military.  They were not only Air Force members, there were also Army, Navy, and Marines that entered this dining facility.  Here, we do the practical military thing, we "serve three square meals a day" with no discreptancies.  These discreptancies that often stop military dining facilities from working are usually undercooked meals, lack of customer service, military hygiene and bacterial workspaces.  

For this project, I was the lead cook for Aragon Dining Facility.  This responsibility involved management of personnel, maintenance of the Dining Facility that involves cleanliness, hygiene, and proper cooking and training.  This also involved military spending as well as resourcement of goods and services.  I expected the people above and under me to work together.  I felt like if we had confict, it could be easily resolved as far as I was concerned because we all worked well.  There wasn't a single thing that we couldn't have done.
