This project involved three student developers.  As a team, we were responsible for creating our own website application from a meteor template created in ReactJS, HTML, CSS, and Semantic-UI.  We were given a meteor template that already had log-in code and some custom navbar and footer templates written in ReactJS.  In order to create an attractive sales website, we had to start from scratch and ask ourselves, "what would the user want to do with this website?", "what kinds of things could we add into this website that would make the user keep coming to visit this website?",  "how user-friendly can we make this website?".  

With these questions in mind, we created templates from scratch by drawing each page as detailed as we could.  In order to create a well-working sales website, we found inspiration from other various attractive sales websites and emulated their styles of functionality.  Throughout the creation of this project, we completed each question by problem-solving our way through step-by-step coding concepts.  We also had to work together often to ask each other questions to understand the problem that we are having as well as to solve the problem correctly.  Misunderstandings can most likely create more problems than fix the original problem itself.  That is why it is best to ask alot of questions, even if you have the slightest misunderstanding.  <img src="../images/MockpageJL.jpg">

After we have created templates for these pages, it was time for us to create them in real-time creative coding sessions.  Since there were three of us, we each had different things to do evenly.  For example, I was responsible for creating the navigation bar.  My other two classmates was responsible for creating the navigation bar and the background.  Once we finished doing this, we combined all three of these properties to create the main template for our website's landing page.  <img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/LandingPageJohnsonsList.png">

Once we combined our efforts, we used some sophisticated code to make the website look more authentic.  We used a sidebar on the store page that filtered different types of items when clicked (for example, the sidebar has an "electronics" tab that filters all items that involves electronics).  This was not the only idea that we used for this website.  We refined a top navigation bar that also has a searchbar (for searching different items), add item tab (for adding an item), store tab (for viewing items), and website guide (for first-time users).  We made a feedback form on the top right side of the profile icon when clicked and various other front-end functional web properties that was implemented into our website.  This involved some major problem-solving and teamwork skills to achieve this kind of functionality.  On the way to complete the project, we have learned a whole lot about how difficult it is to create an actual working website.  <img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/HomePageJohnsonsList.png">

After four weeks, with some intense coding sessions, deploying sessions, and github.io page editing sessions, we got a working professional template for both the actual project and the do-it-yourself project support website.
